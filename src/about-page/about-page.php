                            OFS (Organic Food Service) is an organic food delivery service based in San Jose, California in the United States. 
                            Founded in 2024, OFS strives to be able to compete with other top food delivery services whilst also serving the community. 
                            Despite having a very small staff, we at OFS are determined to succeed in our mission and plan to do so.

                            Our mission is to provide the community with fresh, organic goods. We at OFS believe that the foundation of a healthy and functioning 
                            community is its food source. By providing and delivering locally sourced fresh and organic goods, we are able to not only provide for the 
                            community, but help local farms and suppliers that would otherwise be overshadowed by the larger food companies.

                            We at OFS gurantee an organic food delivery service that is locally sourced and ethically priced. We do not work towards the extortion of local 
                            farms and suppliers, but rather the prosperity of the community as a whole. Our prices will always be community oriented and take first priority, 
                            thus ensuring the stability and loyalty of our customers.
